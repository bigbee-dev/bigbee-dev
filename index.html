            <p class="my-4">
              I’ve worked on all levels of the software stack, from defining the
              strategy to shaping projects to designing interfaces to writing
              code to marketing.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
              I started working as a programmer in Singapore in 2006. Over 9
              years - before I came back in 2015 to Myanmar, I worked for
              companies from MNC companies like UTAC, HP to startups like
              Maloft. Always looking to understand the bigger picture, my role
              evolved from Programmer to Architect to Chief Technology Officer.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
              After I was back in Myanmar in 2015, I founded my first business,
              Kanoak, with my wife. Kanoak is now a well-known online shop in
              Myanmar. We managed to release our own Kanoak app in 2021. During
              these years, I learned a lot about running a business, managing
              cash flow, sales and marketing - especially Facebook marketing.
            </p>
            <p class="my-4">
              In 2017, I founded my second business, Piti, with my two friends.
              We released our app, Piti - Loyalty platform for businesses. I
              left Piti in 2020 with plenty of experience building and selling a SaaS product.
